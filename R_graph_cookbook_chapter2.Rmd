## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

## R graph cookbook examples

```{r}
library(dplyr,verbose = FALSE)
library(ggplot2)
```

```{r}
plot(mtcars$wt, mtcars$mpg)
```

using ggplot2 to plot 

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(mtcars, aes(x = wt, y = mpg)) + 
    geom_point()
```

or

```r
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(data = NULL, aes(x = mtcars$wt, y = mtcars$mpg)) + 
    geom_point()
```


plot the line...

```{r}
plot(pressure$temperature, pressure$pressure, type = 'l')
points(pressure$temperature, pressure$pressure, col = "red")
```

```{r}
ggplot(pressure, aes(x = temperature, y = pressure)) + 
    geom_line() +
    geom_point(color='red')
```

#### 2.3 Creating a Bar Graph

barplot

```{r}
BOD
barplot(BOD$demand, names.arg = BOD$Time)
```

when the x is continuous
```{r}
ggplot(BOD, aes(x = Time, y = demand)) + 
    geom_col()
```

when the x is discrete
```{r}
ggplot(BOD, aes(x = factor(Time), y = demand)) + 
    geom_col()
```

#### create a histogram

```{r}
hist(mtcars$mpg, breaks = 8)
```

```{r}
ggplot(mtcars, aes(x = mpg)) + 
    geom_histogram(binwidth = 4)
```

#### create a boxplot

```{r}
plot(ToothGrowth$supp, ToothGrowth$len)
```

```{r}
boxplot(len ~ supp, data = ToothGrowth)
```

```{r}
ggplot(ToothGrowth, aes(x = supp, y = len)) + 
    geom_boxplot()
```
